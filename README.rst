kokuen
-----------

Kokuen is a system that will provide visibility into performance trends *and*
performance outliers via a nexus dashboard displaying user-defined statistics
and charts aggregated through statsd and graphite.

Kokuen is the romanization of 黒鉛 (lit. black lead), Japanese for graphite. 
Various carbon and graphite-related names were already used for similar
projects, and Japanese is cruise control for web 2.0 chic.
